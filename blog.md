 # Native Script
NativeScript is a cross-platform framework that allows developers to build native mobile applications for iOS and Android platforms using JavaScript and TypeScript. It is an open-source framework that is gaining popularity among mobile app developers due to its unique features and advantages. In this blog, we will take a closer look at what NativeScript is, how it works, and why it is a great option for mobile app development.

 ## What is NativeScript?

NativeScript is a framework that allows developers to build mobile apps using a single codebase, which can be shared between iOS and Android platforms. It is built on top of the popular JavaScript runtime engine, Node.js, and is designed to provide a native experience to mobile app users. NativeScript allows developers to use popular web technologies such as Angular, Vue.js, and React to build mobile applications. It is based on the same principles as other popular cross-platform frameworks such as React Native and Xamarin.

 ## How does NativeScript work?

NativeScript uses a bridge that connects JavaScript code to native code. The bridge is responsible for converting JavaScript code into native code that can be executed on the device. The bridge is built using C++ and provides a seamless integration between the JavaScript code and the native code. NativeScript also uses a just-in-time (JIT) compiler to optimize the performance of the application.

 ## Advantages of NativeScript

Cross-Platform Development: NativeScript allows developers to build mobile applications for both iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase. This significantly reduces the development time and cost.

 ### Native Experience: 
 NativeScript provides a native experience to mobile app users. It uses native components and APIs to build mobile applications, which makes them look and feel like native applications.

 ### Large Community:
  NativeScript has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the development of the framework. This ensures that the framework is constantly evolving and improving.

 ### Extensible:
  NativeScript is highly extensible and allows developers to use plugins to add functionality to their applications. There are several plugins available for NativeScript that can be easily integrated into the application.

 ### Easy to Learn:
  NativeScript is easy to learn for developers who have experience with JavaScript and web development. The framework uses popular web technologies such as Angular, Vue.js, and React, which makes it easy to get started.

 ## Conclusion

NativeScript is a powerful framework for building native mobile applications for iOS and Android platforms. It allows developers to use a single codebase to build applications, which significantly reduces development time and cost. NativeScript provides a native experience to mobile app users and is highly extensible. It is easy to learn for developers who have experience with JavaScript and web development. With its unique features and advantages, NativeScript is a great option for mobile app development.
